## Overview

 What makes this package featured?

- Improves the **query time** more than any package, even **Laravel** itself ([fig. 1.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-01.png)).
- Gives you a `Query Builder` and `Eloquent Builder` instances via **ONLY one syntax**.
- Fixes the **Ambiguous Exception** thrown by Laravel when the same column is used from the model and its relationship in the "order" query.
- IMO, The most wonderful feature is that it enables you to order the result by the model relationships (`HasOne`, `HasMany`, `BelongsTo`, and `BelongsToMany`) and keeps you away from performing the "join" manually ([fig. 3.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-03.png)).

> The package was significantly FASTER than the Laravel query when tested on over **1k records** ([fig. 2.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-02.png)). ðŸ¥µ

## Overview

 What makes this package featured?

- **Accelerated Query Performance:**
  - Significantly  improved query performance compared to native Laravel ([fig. 1.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-01.png)).

- **Straightforward and Unified Syntax:**
  - Provides a unified, consistent syntax for `Query Builder` and `Eloquent Builder`.

- **Resolved Ambiguous Exception:**
  - Fixes the ambiguous exception that can occur when using the same column in both models and their relationships during ordering.

- **Simplified Relationship Ordering:**
  - Easily order results by model relationships (`HasOne`, `HasMany`, `BelongsTo`, `BelongsToMany`) without using manual joins ([fig. 3.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-03.png)).

- **Efficient Batch Updates:**
  - Streamline multiple updates with a single, concise method; for more details, refer to [update.md](UPDATE.md).

> The package was considerably FASTER than the Laravel query when tested on over **1k records** ([fig. 2.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model/refs/heads/main/assets/easy-model-vs-laravel-02.png)). ðŸ¥µ
